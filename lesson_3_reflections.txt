When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
you might do this when you wan t access from multiple machines.
you might enable this to provide a way for many peopel to work on a project together
you might do this to provide back-up and security in the case of a devestating probelm with your machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
if you are workign together eith peopel or you have a public repository where 
others can make suggestions thigns may be inserted and you may not be prepared for those suggestions
they may confuse you or be irrelevant to you.   Why clutter up your local workign space without you knowing
what is going on.
